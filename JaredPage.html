<P>Hello! My name is Jared Torp and I am a computer science major with a focus 
    in cyber security. I started my CS learning career about 4 years ago at Oklahoma Christian University.
    I am a senior graduating in the 2022 Spring semester and I hope to be working for the United States Air Force.

    I first fell in love with technology at a young age. My father had a family computer in the basement of our Cincinnati home in 2002. In my free time as a kid,
    I would play computer games. The first computer games that I played were "Space Cadet Pinball" on the windows 95 Operating System, 
    "Disney's Magic Artist Studio", and "VeggieTales: The Mystery of Veggie Island." There are a lot more computer games and video games I played as a kid, but those
    are the few that I remember
</p>
<p>
    I always had a love for computers and technology, so during the summer of 2019, I decided to attend Oklahoma Christian University to pursue a career in 
    computer science! I found a love for problem solving and creating software during my years of college! I hope to use my knowledge for the United States Air Force
    and become a software engineer after graduation.
