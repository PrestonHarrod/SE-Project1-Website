<h1>Why Should I be a CS Major?</h1>
<p>You may be wondering, "why should I study Computer Science?" To help see if CS is the right choice for you, we put 5 reasons why Computer Science
may be the choice for you!</p>

<ol>
    <li>Computing is a part of everything that we do!</li>
    <p>In the 21st century, technology is all around us! From Television, 
        to Cars, Gaming Systems, Automated Cash Registers, Phones, Government Systems, 
        and more, tech has become the standard in our daily lives. With so much technology we need people to 
        help develop, test, and maintain software on technological devices!
    </p>

    <li>A knowledge in computing helps you solve problems!</li>
    <p>According to the Association of Computing Machinery: 
        "Computing is a discipline that offers rewarding and challenging possibilities for a wide range of people regardless 
        of their range of interests. Computing requires and develops capabilities in solving deep, multidimensional problems 
        requiring imagination and sensitivity to a variety of concerns."
    </p>

    <li>Financially rewarding!</li>
    <p>Computer Scientists are among the most highly paid in the world. 
        According to ZipRecruiter, the national average pay for computer Scientists
        is $70,080 a year! to learn more about CS careers, check out our "CS Career Page"  <a href="CSCareers.html">here!</a> <!--Link is not here yet because I dont have the site yet-->
    </p>
   

    <li>Computer Science is a blend of problem solving and creativity!</li>
    <p> It is a common misconception that computer scientists are only problem solvers. However, both problem solving skills and creativity are required to make 
        compatible and functional software systems! Some examples of creativity are algorithms, games, digital art, virtual reality, and more!
    </p>

    <li>Your work impacts the world!</li>
    <p> Computer Scientists research advancements to make lives easier and better. Computer scientists help sto cyber attacks, help businesses, governments, healthcare, and more!
