<p>Software impacts every aspect of our daily lives from the cars we drive, the phones we use, how we bank, and buy items online or at the store.
    There are many different programming languages and areas of focus within computer science that it may be difficult to know where to begin.
     A good place to start is researching areas that interest you! Some of the major areas that you can find offered at most universities are: </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <p>If you are have a desire to develop programs from the ground up, manage databases, create mobile applications, or maintain current software programs,
            then you may want to consider this major.
        </p>
        <li>Computer Science with a focus in Business</li>
            <p>This gives someone the opportunity to get the foundation of computer science, but also branch out and learn those skills in the context
                of a business environment.
            </p>
        <li>Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity</li>
            <p>With everything depending more and more on the computers and the internet, there is an ever growing need to make these systems more secure. 
                Cybersecurity is the process of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring
                 confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. If this interests you, then cybersecurity is for you. </p>
        <li>Computer Science with a focus in Gaming and Animation</li>
            <p>If you have a creative side, and have an interest in learning the processes that go into making various types of video games then this path may
                be just for you.
            </p>
        
    </ul>
<p>If any of these areas of study interest you, then you are off to a great start. As you further research the specific path
    you may want to pursue, you will then begin to discover which programming languages and tools would best fit your interests. There
    are several great resources to begin to learn within those programming environments and best of all, they're free! Some to
    note to help get you started are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Codeacademy.com</li>
    <li>Bitdegree.org</li>
    <li>Edx.org</li>
    <li>Udemy.com</li>
    <li>W3Schools.com</li>
    <li>Pluralsight.com</li>

</ul>
<p>These sites offer plenty of free and paid courses, and are a great way to get started. If computer science is a career you want
    to pursue, then getting a degree may be your next step. Oklahoma Christian University offers all the degree plans listed above
    and offers an excellent academic environment to accelerate your knowledge and experience in programming. Check out our <a href="Oklahoma_Christian_University.html">Oklahoma Christian University</a> page to learn more!
