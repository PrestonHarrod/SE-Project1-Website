  <p>Looking to learn all the aspects of CS as a whole is sure to be daunting, but there are small ways to break down the major components 
    while you are still in high school. Here are some options:
</p>

<h3>High School Courses </h3>
<p>One of the best ways to prepare for a CS degree is to start out taking Computer Science courses in High School. Some examples of courses to take are: 
<ul>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>AP Computer Science</li>
<li>Computer Science Principles</li>
<li>AP Computer Science Principles</li> 
<li>Computer Architecture</li>
<li>Computer Literacy</li>
</ul>
Something to consider is to take the regular version of these classes before taking the AP versions as the regular version will give you experience
going into the more difficult class. Taking the AP classes for CS is also a great way to prepare for college as they count towards your college credit.
By getting these classes out of the way now, you will not only save money if you pass the AP exam, but you will also start to build a foundation for
a CS mindset. 
There may be other classes that your high school offers specifically, so be sure to research what options are available.
<br><br>Another option to prepare for the CS world is to take classes at a local vocational technical school/technology center.
These VoTechs are an amazing option to gain more real world experience as the goal of a VoTech is to prepare people for a real job. 
Usually, you will take half of your school day at your high school and half at the VoTech, and to make sure that you have enough credits, 
most high schools allow you to go to a VoTech in your junior and senior years.
</p>

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
Regardless of prior experience with coding, starting any personal project is a great way to learn the basics and eventually make something that you will be proud of.
A personal project does not have to be a massive undergoing. Start small like making the classic game of Pong.
One of the benefits of working on a personal project is that you can list them on resumes.
Employers search for people that have a passion for programming and having a list of personal projects is one of the best ways to tell.
Having a list of personal projects will also allow employers to see not only your own skillset, but also your hobbies.
</p>


<h3>Computer Knowledge</h3>
<p>
While it might seem like an obvious that general computer knowledge is vital to being a CS major, there is a lot of helpful
skills to learn that some people are not aware of.

<h5>Typing</h5>
Typing may not seem like the most forefront skill to learn when trying to program; however, being able to type fast and well will make 
your whole programming experience much easier and less frustrating.
Typing.com is a great free resource to help teach the standard way to type.

<h5>Keyboard Shortcuts</h5>
Likewise with typing, learning the available keyboard shortcuts will allow you to work much more effieciently.
Shortcuts like Alt+Tab to switch between open windows on your computer are essential 
Combining typing with keyboard shortcuts will make your flow together easier and will allow you to focus more on the content
of the programming rather than the act of programming itself.

<h5>Microsoft Excel</h5>
Excel is an industry standard for data storage and management.
The essentials of Excel may be taught in a Computer literacy class in high school.
Excel has advanced functions that will apply an algorithm to multiple cells at once, so learning the syntax of how to make and apply 
that algorithm is an important skill to learn.
