<p>Hi! My name is Logan Christopher and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
    I am in my senior year at Oklahoma Christian University, and will graduate after the Fall 2022 semester.
    Upon graduating, I will begin working as a computer scientist for the Air Force at Tinker, AFB located
     in Oklahoma City, OK.  </p>

<p>My CS journey started about 2 years ago while a friend of mine was showing me a few of his applications
    and programs. After looking over the source code and seeing how software is developed, I immediately began
    learning on my own. I started learning the basics of python and C++ before deciding to change my major to
    computer science. Once I finished my active duty service with the Coast Guard, I moved back to Oklahoma and
    transferred to Oklahoma Christian University.
</p>

<p>The time I've spent at Oklahoma Christian University has been a rewarding one. My programming experience and knowledge has
    vastly improved since my self-learning days, and the support from the professors is a big part of my success thus far. I would
    recommend OC to anyone considering a career path in computer science.
    
</p>
<p>if anyone has any questions about pursuing computer science or my experience studying computer science, 
    email me here: <a href="mailto:logan.christopher@eagles.oc.edu">Logan Christopher</a></p>
