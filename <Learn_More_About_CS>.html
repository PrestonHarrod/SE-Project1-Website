<h1>Learn more about Computer Science!</h1>
<p>Software impacts every aspect of our daily lives from the cars we drive, the phones we use, how we bank, and buy items online or at the store.
    There are many different programming languages and areas of focus within computer science that it may be difficult to know where to begin.
     A good place to start is researching areas that interest you! Some of the major areas that you can find offered at most universities are: </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity</li>
            <p>With everything depending more and more on the computers and the internet, there is an ever growing need to make these systems more secure. 
                Cybersecurity is the process of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring
                 confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. If this interests you, then cybersecurity is for you. </p>
        <li>Computer Science with a focus in Gaming and Animation</li>
            <p>If you have a creative side, and have an interest in learning the processes that go into making various types of video games then this path may
                be just for you.
            </p>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
            <p>If you are have a desire to develop programs from the ground up, manage databases, create mobile applications, or maintain current software programs,
