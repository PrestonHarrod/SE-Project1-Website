<h1>CS Careers</h1>

<p>The CS field has a variety of different jobs to pursue. The field of computer science main focus is making software and the study of software systems. 
    A degree in the computer science field means that an educated individual has a variety of paths to pursue.
According to Salvatore Stolfo, Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, says "it is the golden age right now for computer science, and we are very fortunate 
for this field"  
</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for computer scientists is growing. 
Between 2016 and 2026, the employment for computer and information technology is expected to increase by 13%, faster than the national average for other occupations.
From the same study, computer scientists frequently make six figure salaries! In May 2018, the median salary among computer and information research scientists was $118,370.
</p>

<p>We know that computer scientist are high in demand and have great opportunity for pay, but how many jobs are there for a computer scientist? 
    Do all computer scientists code? The most common path for a computer scientist is a software developer. However, below is a full list where computer scientists
    are a major asset:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Data scientist</li>
<li>Software tester</li>
<li>Web developer</li>
<li>Systems analyst</li>
<li>Business analyst</li>
<li>Product manager</li>
<li>Network architect</li>
<li>Software engineer</li>
<li>Software developer</li>
<li>Full-stack developer</li>
<li>Engineering manager</li>
<li>User interface designer</li>
<li> Database administrator</li>
<li>Cloud computing engineer</li>
<li>Information security analyst</li>
<li>Computer science professor</li>
<li>Chief information security officer</li>
<li>Software quality assurance manager</li>
<li>Information technology specialist</li>
<li>Mobile application designer/developer</li>
<li>Research and development (R&D) scientist</li>
<li>Computer scientist or computer science researcher</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you can see from the list above, there are a variety of jobs for computer scientists, and the field continues to innovate and grow! 
    According to Hannah Pierce-Hoffman, a software test engineer at ASML, states "Almost every type of company
    relies on software infrastructure to some degree; almost every new technology being developed has a type of software component" </p>
    
<p>If any of these fields sound interesting, 
    Computer Science might be the field for you!
