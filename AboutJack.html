<h1>About Jack Hannah</h1>

<h3>College</h3>
<p>
    My name is Jack Hannah, and I am currently a senior at Oklahoma Christian University. 
    I am currently working on a dual-degree program to get my Bachelor's and my Master's at the same, my Bachelor's
    being Computer Science with Gaming and Animation and my Master's being Computer Science with an AI focus.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<p>
    One of my favorite hobbies, as could be told by my degree path, is gaming with my favorite genre being FPS.
    Competitive games like Overwatch, Splitgate, and Rocket League are where I sink a lot of my time. Another one of
    my hobbies is reading, and my favorite genre is fantasy. My favorite book series is Stormlight Archives by Brandon
    Sanderson, and I am currently reading Magic Kingdom For Sale. The last hobby that I will list is Disc Golfing. OC is 
    home to a great disc golfing course to practice the basics and is often where I go to practice.
