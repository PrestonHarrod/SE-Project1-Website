<h1>About Us: Jack Hannah</h1>

<p>
    My name is Jack Hannah, and I am currently a senior at Oklahoma Christian University. 
    I am currently working on a dual-degree program to get my Bachelor's and my Master's at the same, my Bachelor's
    being Computer Science with Gaming and Animation and my Master's being Computer Science with an AI focus.

    The reason that I chose Computer Science as my major is because my background, first of all. I grew up
    with a dad who was an IT guy, and he was always working on some computer project. There were always spare 
    computer parts around the house. These experiences that I had with my dad growing up was the gateway into 
    my interests with computers. Going into high school is where I diverge from my dad's path a bit as I became
    more interested in the software than the hardware. I took many computer classes in high school and wound up
    attending a VoTech called Francis Tuttle for Software Development. By this point, I was fairly sure that Computer
    Science was the field that I wanted to go into, and that's how I ended up coming to OC.

    One of my favorite hobbies, as could be told by my degree path, is gaming with my favorite genre being FPS.
    Competitive games like Overwatch, Splitgate, and Rocket League are where I sink a lot of my time. Another one of
    my hobbies is reading, and my favorite genre is fantasy. My favorite book series is Stormlight Archives by Brandon
    Sanderson, and I am currently reading Magic Kingdom For Sale. The last hobby that I will list is Disc Golfing. OC is 
    home to a great disc golfing course to practice the basics and is often where I go to practice.
